# Academic Integrity Statement

From the syllabus: "For each project, you are expected to include a list of the people with whom you have consulted (including students, IT guides, instructors, or anyone outside of our learning community) and resources used (including webpages and source code repositories, outside of our course learning materials) as part of your project. This information should be included in a file named academic-integrity-statement.md. If you did not use any outside resources, be sure to specify that in your document."
